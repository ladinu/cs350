A = {a1, a2, a3, ..., a_n}
B = {b1, b2, b3, ..., b_m}

a) The algorithm compare every element in A with every element in B. If an
   element in A and B are the same, that element is added to set C. The
   efficiency class for the following algorithm is O(nm).

      function SUBSET(A, B)
         // Input: Set A and B with n and m elements
         // Output: Intersection of A and B
         C = {}
         for i=1 to n do
            for j=1 to m do
               if A[i] == B[j] then 
                  C.add(A[i])
         return C
b)
